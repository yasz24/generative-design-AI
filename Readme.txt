- A guide on how to navigate the code for this project:
- CSP.py: The CSP object used to formulate the problem and associated classes to initialize variable, domains and checkConstraints.
- backtrackingSearch.py: Implementation of the recursive backtracking search algorithms, with and without the heurisitic.
- regression.py: Our implementaion of linear regression using the gradient descent and the normal equations. 
- extractSubStructures.py: Extracting substructres from our dataset of full structures--used to run regression and learn weights off.
- featureExtractor.py: The object that extracts features  for the linear regression from the structres provided to it. 
- System.py: The finite element solver used to evaluate the stability of structures by calculating the displacement at each node in the structure, under load.
- Database.txt: Our training data-set, generated using the randomized version of backtracking search.
