- Fix Singular Matrix Error. Anthony
- Look into linear regression. See if any open source frameworks can be used.  
- Features
	-We are trying out are maximum displacement in a structure, the difference between the number of points on the right half of the structure versus the left half, the total length of the beams, the maximum length of any beam in the structure, and average angle size between the beams in the structure.  

- Data Collection 
- Schema for data
- modify domain to include points in space
- change domain updation such that any domains with atleast one of the nodes in the structures as start points are valid.
- make no.of beams independent of grid size.
